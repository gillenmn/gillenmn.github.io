Hello! I'm currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](mit.whoi.edu) studying coastal geomorphology. I use a combination of numerical modeling, remote sensing, data science, and field/lab work to understand how coastlines change in shape and size over geologic time scales. I'm primarily interested in nearshore, reef, and volcanic ocean islands.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
