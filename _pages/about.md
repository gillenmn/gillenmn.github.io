Hello! I'm currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](https://mit.whoi.edu) studying coastal geomorphology. I use a combination of numerical modeling, remote sensing, data science, and field/lab work to understand how coastlines change in shape and size over geologic time scales. I'm primarily interested in nearshore, reef, and volcanic ocean islands.
