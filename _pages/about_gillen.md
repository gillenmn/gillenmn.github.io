I'm currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](https://mit.whoi.edu) studying coastal geomorphology. I work primarily with [Dr. Andrew Ashton](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/aashton/) from the Geology & Geophysics department at WHOI, and with [Dr. Taylor Perron](https://taylorperron.org/) from MIT EAPS. I use a combination of numerical modeling, remote sensing, data science, and field/lab work to understand how coastlines change in shape and size over geologic time scales. I'm primarily interested in nearshore environments, coral reefs, and volcanic ocean islands.

Before the Joint Program, I got my Bachelors of Science in Geology from [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/geology/) with a Minor in Data Science. I worked with Dr. Matt Kirwan in the [Coastal Ecogeomorphology Lab](https://mattkirwanmarsh.com/) for my honors thesis examining the vulnerability and resilience of tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient in southeastern Virginia. Part of my honors thesis was published in Earth Surface Dynamics in 2021, which you can check out in my [publications](/publications).

My research interests broadly include:

    (1) Dynamics & temporal thresholds between terrestrial and marine processes at ocean islands
    
    (2) Identifying morphologic signatures of dominant surface processes through time in coastal environments
    
    (3) Connections between ecology and geomorphology in coastal sediment budgets and long-term evolution
    
    (4) Integrating large data sets into numerical modeling to improve accuracy & add complexity
